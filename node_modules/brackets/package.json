  "readme": "Node-Brackets\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNode-Brackets is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) module implemented as [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) middleware which \r\nintegrates [Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/) code editor in Node.js based web applications. \r\nIt provides exceptionally convenient way to manage, edit and test project files \r\ndirectly on the server via web browser. Brackets doesn't have to be installed on \r\nclient machines, it opens in a web browser and communicates with the server over\r\nstandard HTTP or HTTPS protocol.\r\n\r\nThis module might be useful for remote development, real-time changes and testing, \r\ndevelopment form a thin client or device such as tablet, or it could be used in \r\nconjunction with other modules for collaboration.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstall from npm:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install brackets\r\n\r\nUsage Examples\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nCreate test app:\r\n\r\n    $ mkdir my-app\r\n    $ cd my-app\r\n    $ npm install connect\r\n    . . .\r\n    $ npm install brackets\r\n    . . .\r\n    \r\nAdd index.js file to my-app directory and enter the following code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    var connect     = require('connect'),\r\n        brackets    = require('brackets');\r\n        \r\n    connect()\r\n        .use('/brackets', brackets())\r\n        .use(function (req, res) {\r\n            res.end('Hello World');\r\n        })\r\n        .listen(3000);\r\n    \r\n    console.log(\"\\n  listening on port 3000\\n\");\r\n```\r\n    \r\nStart the app:\r\n    \r\n    $ node index\r\n    \r\nOpen Google Chrome bowser and type **http://localhost:3000** in the address bar. \r\nAt this point you should see “Hello World”. Navigate to **http://localhost:3000/brackets**. \r\nNow you should see Brackets UI and the contents of your working directory, including Brackets source.\r\n\r\nTo limit the access to specific directory/s you can pass an argument to brackets function.\r\n\r\n* **brackets(\"resources\");** \r\n  the directory **\"./resources/\"** will become the project root.\r\n\r\n* **brackets(\\[\"controllers\", \"views\", \"public\"\\]);** \r\n  the directory **\"./controllers/\"** will become the initial project root and the other folders will be accessible via\r\n  Recent Projects dropdown (the small arrow above the navigation tree).\r\n  \r\nNOTE: the specified directories must exist, otherwise an exception will be thrown.\r\n\r\nThere is an example project based on [Express](http://expressjs.com/) MVC example, \r\nlocated in [https://github.com/rabchev/node-brackets-module/tree/master/examples/express-mvc](https://github.com/rabchev/node-brackets-module/tree/master/examples/express-mvc).\r\n\r\nIf you want to be able to see your code changes immediately on the live site, without manually restarting Node, \r\nyou could use [node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) or similar module.\r\n\r\nSecurity Considerations\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nAuthentication and authorization are outside the scope of this module.\r\nThey should be done by other modules, configured to intercept the request prior to Node-Brackets.\r\n\r\nSince Node-Brackets exposes server files for modification over HTTP/HTTPS, it is absolutely critical to \r\nproperly protect your network or file system. It is strongly recommended **not** to use this module on\r\nproduction sites, unless you truly understand the security of your system.\r\n\r\nBrowser Compatibility\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nApparently, Brackets is currently working properly only in Google Chrome. \r\nIt kind of works in Firefox but it has some styling problems and JavaScript errors. \r\nIt doesn’t work at all in Internet Explorer. \r\nHowever, these problems should be referred to Brackets core team.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Delete command doesn’t refresh correctly the active documents tabs and an error \r\n  message is displayed if an open document is deleted.\r\n  \r\n  Delete command is currently added as an extension, but I believe it should be Brackets core \r\n  function in the future and therefore I’m not planning to spend more time on Delete.\r\n  \r\n* Check for updates command doesn’t work.\r\n\r\n  This is due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing not allowed by http://dev.brackets.io/updates/stable/en-US.json.\r\n  I believe this issue can be resolved only by Brackets team.\r\n  \r\n* Show Developer Tools - doesn't work.\r\n\r\n  Will be fixed.\r\n  \r\n* Performance data always shows 0.\r\n\r\n  Will be fixed.\r\n\r\n* Live Preview - doesn't work.\r\n\r\n  Will be fixed.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n\r\n* Move \"Find in Files\" on the server-side – performance optimization.\r\n* Make global install - for easer project creation.\r\n* Integrate NPM in the UI\r\n* Integrate Supervisor, possibility Brackets to be served from second port.\r\n\r\nUpdating Brackets source code\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n(MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Boyan Rabchev <boyan@rabchev.com>.
